Dear ${customer.entityId}
<br />
<br />
We recently contacted you to let you know that your Frugi Order ${transaction.tranid} is ready for us to send to our warehouse for packing, as per the details in the attached proforma. However, we cannot send your order to our warehouse for processing until payment has been received.
<br />
<br />
<b>If you have made payment within the last few days please ignore this email as it sometimes takes a few days to update your account.</b>
<br />
<br />
If you haven’t yet paid and you would still like to receive your order we will need payment as soon as possible. If for any reason you are unable to make payment please let us know or unfortunately we will cancel your order and release the stock so that it is available to other customers.
