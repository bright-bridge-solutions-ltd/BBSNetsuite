<strong>3rd Reminder</strong>
<br />
<br />
Hi ${customer.entityId},
<br />
<br />
Overdue Account Balance: ${customer.overdueBalance}
<br />
<br />
Despite our previous email dated ${customer.custentity_c4c_last_reminder_email_date}; the debt remains unpaid.
<br />
<br />
We write to advise you that should we not receive payment within 7 days or reasons why payment should not be made, we will have no alternative but to pass this debt to our credit insurers, Euler Hermes for collection. We are contractually obliged to report any account which exceeds 90 days from invoice date.
<br />
<br />
Please be aware if this action is taken your company will be liable for additional collection costs such as late payment and interest charges under “The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Regulations) 2013”. There is also the likelihood of the credit insurance being removed, which will result in your account reverting to a proforma basis.
<br />
<br />
We would therefore respectfully suggest that you treat this matter with the urgency it requires and remit the full balance due as soon as possible. We are reluctant to take the action, but we will have no alternative if we do not receive the payment in full.
<br />
<br />
Please find the appropriate bank details below for you to process your payment.
